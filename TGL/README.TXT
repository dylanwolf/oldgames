III. Et Cetera
     
   A. KEYS
     Without keys, some doors are blocked.
   
   B. ONE-WAY DOORS
     There are several one-way doors in the palace.  When you step through,
     the next room will have a wall where the door was.

   C. WEAPONS
     There are four weapons and four armors you may get:
  1. Sword           2. Axe                  3. Sickle       4. Excalibur
  1. Clothes         2. Leather Clothes      3. Plate Mail   4. Plate Armor
     
   D. BATTLES
     You don't control battles, as attack is your only option.  There are
     several rooms where monsters are set to guard.  Other monsters are just
     wandering.

     Monsters:
      Vampire Bat                               Specter
      Warrior                                   Lizard
      Ghost                                     Snake
      Ghost Knight                              Scorpion
      Dragon                                    Baby Dragon

     When you destroy an enemy, you might get food (raises HP by 5), and 
     helmets (Defense+1).  You will gain health from experience.

   E. SPECIAL TREASURE CHESTS
     Randomly, treasure chests will be in rooms.  They may contain:   
        Genie - enemy
        Chest Monster - enemy
        Acid - 5 HP damage
        Food - 5 HP gain

   F. SPECIAL NOTE
     You may bypass the title screen and menu and go into the game by
     typing
                                     MAZE
     at the DOS prompt


IV. About the Author

      My name is Dylan Wolf and I am 14 years old.  Right now (1996), I am
 beginning the 10th grade.  I learned to program by reading and running
 programs in a magazine and observing what certain commands did.  I also
 used on-line help in a BASIC program to teach myself the language, which
 I used for this program.
